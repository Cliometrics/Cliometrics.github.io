# Welcome!

This is the website of _Cliometrics Study Group_ organised by Economic History graduate students at the University of Tokyo.

We hold a weekly meeting to read and discuss academic articles on economic history and applied microeconomics with historical data.  
Our current focus is on the interplay of culture and institutions in history.

<!-- Please note that the website is still under construction. -->
